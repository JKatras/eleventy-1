Every apprentice is responsible for successfully completing an outlined in-class curriculum as a part of their apprenticeship.

Classroom instruction provides apprentices with information that complements their on-the-job training, giving them a well-rounded education and knowledge base as they learn their trade.

Classes are taken through the following institutions based on the apprenticeâ€™s trade:

*   [Charlottesville-Albemarle Technical Education Center](http://www.catec.org/) (CATEC)
*   [Massanutten Technical Center](http://www.mtcva.com/Home.aspx)
*   [Valley Vocational Technical School](http://www.augusta.k12.va.us/valleyvts/site/default.asp) (Valley Vo-Tech)

Apprentices are usually scheduled for one to two classes per semester, depending on the school's program requirements. A total of six to eight classes will be completed during a four-year apprenticeship. Classes and books are paid for by UVA Facilities Management.
